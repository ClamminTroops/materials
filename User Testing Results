Usability Test Report

  For our usability tests, we chose to test the five main app functionalities (list a pet, take a quiz, adopt a pet, create an account, 
and view your matches) to see how well our users could understand the app’s logic. The tasks included creating an account with a username 
and password, putting a dog up for adoption and contacting the adopter, taking the quiz, and updating their profile information. 
  We also asked for reactions about the user interface, verbiage, and overall impression. To best understand our users, we began by 
asking preliminary questions about their familiarity with dating app interfaces, their likelihood to adopt a dog, and where else they might look to find a pet. 
As the tests proceeded, we noticed some recurring issues that users encountered with our app. These issues include:
  -Lack of a button to go back to the homepage once he or she entered an activity
  -Confusion with the scrolling feature of the quiz
  -Quiz questions that didn’t seem relevant to a person’s dog search, such as
     -Grooming preferences 
     -Shedding preferences 
  -My Matches button not working on the “My Profile” page
  -Inability to unmatch with a pet
The usability tests also encouraged us to change some of the verbiage within our app, as some of our current word choices were not clear
to our users. Some of the words and phrases we intend to change include:
  -The word ‘wiry,’ used to describe dog fur
  -The phrase ‘Quiz,’ which lacked a description of what the quiz is for
  -The phrase ‘List A Pet,’ for putting a pet up for adoption 
  -The phrase ‘Coat Type,’ referring to fur type
Other recommendations included sending new users straight to the “My Profile” page so they can add the information right away, adding 
ages to the pet profiles, adding a drop down menu for dog breeds when listing pets, and adding prices to pet listings. 
  Another larger issue we noticed was the lack of cohesion between the “List A Pet” inputs and the “Adopt A Pet” outputs. It makes sense
that the two should have identical information, and yet our current app has “Adopt A Pet” showing breed, gender, and name, and 
“List A Pet,” requiring breed, gender, name, energy level, house training, and dog size. As we move forward, we intend to make sure
the two match in terms of content. 
	Since our usability tests, we have already begun to distribute the following tasks to make proper adjustments to our app. 
We hope to rectify as many of those issues as possible in order to make Pinder as functional and user-friendly as possible.
